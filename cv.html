<h2>Experience</h2>
<dl>

<dt>Jan.&nbsp;2016–Mar.&nbsp;2018, Developer, Optiver</dt>
<dd>Worked on low-latency trading applications and market connectivity software
for the Tokyo Stock Exchange team. Developed a simulated exchange in Python
based on specification documents. Built a high-performance long-running C++
application to monitor all outgoing and incoming messages from exchange-facing
software to measure timings and other analytics which were forwarded into a
downstream system responsiveness pipeline. Spent latter half working with the
Middle Office development team, developing applications to support daily
reconciliation and accounting reports. Saw through the release of the MARS
accounting and reconciliation tool to production; and oversaw the technical
aspects of its integration into the existing processes of the Taiwan office,
regularly co-ordinating with remote stakeholders and advocating on their behalf
while balancing the needs of existing production users.</dd>

<dt>Jul.&nbsp;2014–Dec.&nbsp;2015, Software Engineer, Freelancer.com</dt>
<dd>Diagnosed and patched bugs in legacy financial PHP code; also integrated
existing back-end with new payment gateways. Joined a tight team developing a
PCI-compliant payment service provider and built Python modules as part of
back-end services and front-end JavaScript within a test-driven development
process. Wrote new extensions to the Jenkins job DSL to encapsulate internal
engineering workflows for continuous integration. Reviewed and authored changes
to configuration managed by Puppet. Interviewed potential candidates for
engineering positions in the Sydney offices. Later, architected and implemented
services supporting the Escrow.com website and accounting stack following the
acquisition of Escrow by Freelancer, including designing the platform
architecture in AWS and database schemata. Continued as lead maintainer of two
production services: the Python-based credit card payment processor and Go file
service.</dd>

<dt>Summer 2012/2013, Summer Research Scholar, NICTA</dt>
<dd>Automated generation of narrative plots: constructed a compiler to
transform out modalities on intentional planning problems, producing
classical planning problems solvable on state-of-the-art planners.</dd>
